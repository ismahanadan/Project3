#Tracking US Health Care Spending by Payer and Health Condition 1996-2016

The goal of this project is to extract, process and create an interactive dashboard on estimates for US spending on healthcare based on two types of payer: public insurance [including Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs] and private insurance and by health condition, age group, sex and type of care for 1996 through 2016. The types of care analyzed in this project were ambulatory, emergency, inpatient and prescribed pharmaceutical care. Government budgets, insurance claims, facility records, household surveys, and official US records from 1996 through 2016 were used to produce the results.For the purposes of this project the health conditions analyzed were: Cardiovascular, Chronic respiratory diseases, Diabetes, urogenital, blood, and endocrine diseases, Injuries, Musculoskeletal disorders, Neoplasms, and Well care.
